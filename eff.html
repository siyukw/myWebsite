  <h1>Efficiently Distracted</h1>
  <h4>April 2019</h4>
  <p>You know that person in your school that seems to be doing everything and knows everyone? I have been that person for as long as I can remember.</p>
  <p>I’ve always thought of myself as someone who is very productive. I always kept a jam packed schedule; I always had somewhere I had to go to or someone I had to meet; I always left my house before 8am and wouldn’t be home until dark. My friends and colleagues were always impressed by the amount of work I could get done everyday. I knew many wonderful people and made many awesome friends, I had amazing internship offers and a great career outlook, and I thought I was doing the whole college thing so damn right. I thought that was the beginning of a glorious life and a successful career.</p>
  <p>Shit hit the fan when I started my off season internship at Google in Mountain View. Don’t get me wrong, life at Google is comfortable. Google provides free company shuttles, free food, and allows flexible work hours. South bay is peaceful, lots of nice suburbs with family restaurants scattered all around. With Google’s generous housing stipend, I got myself a spacious private bedroom with a big window facing a beautiful and sunny backyard. My school also prepared me for the technical challenges very well. I dug into the codebase pretty fast and made satisfying progress on my project steadily. I was more than ready to impress my team and to get that return offer.</p>
	<p>What I wasn’t ready for was being with myself by myself. </p>
	<p>Besides getting to work at a reasonable hour and going to sleep at night, I didn’t have any other commitments. I was left alone with my thoughts, for hours and hours and hours. I didn’t have evening meetings to go to, no one was waiting for me to grade their exams, and there were practically no intern events since its an off season internship. For the first time in a long time, my life went from “what do I have to do” to “what do I want to do”, and I didn’t have an answer for myself. </p>
	<p>“What do I want” is a very scary question to answer, it forces you to make conscious decisions in life and take full responsibility for regrettable choices you’ve made. When I was in Seattle, I never really had to choose what to do on a daily basis. I took on as many roles as I could and just did everything these roles required me to do. My mind was constantly occupied either by things I was doing or things I was about to do. I happily exhausted myself and my mental energy. I packed my schedule full not because I was passionate and enthusiastic about everything I was doing, I packed my schedule because I didn’t know what I wanted and needed constant distractions to fill that void. I distracted myself efficiently for years, so efficiently that when I finally was forced to think about what I want and who I am, my brain is somehow even emptier than my calendar. </p>
	<p>Figuring out what I want and who I am is a painful process. Trying to build up my goals from scratch is difficult, but differentiating what I want from what others expect is even harder. For years, I thrived to be what others expected me to be. My self confidence has always been directly correlated to validation from others. Like ivy vigorously climbing up red brick walls, I thought I was growing fast and strong towards the sky, when in reality I am nothing but a pile of vines without others’ expectations holding me up. I sometimes joke with my friends that this spring marks the beginning of my quarter life crisis. The amount of anxiety, sadness, and fear that came along with unpacking all the emotional baggage I’ve hoarded definitely supports that claim. </p>
	<p>Taking a few months off from being a model college student wasn’t a choice I made consciously, but I am forever grateful for the pain and growth these few months of quietness has brought me. I still don’t have answers to any of the questions I want answers to, but that’s okay. Maybe there are no correct answers to these questions, maybe no one can ever be certain about who they are and what they want, maybe being happily clueless is ultimately the best solution.</p>
	<p>Maybe I only needed the questions, not the answers.</p>
